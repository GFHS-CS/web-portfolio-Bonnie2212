            <h1>Kenney's Web Portfolio</h1>
            <p>I have changed this from adding new links, and by adding in some new forms,<br>
                like making this page have the HTML 5 logo, to know what form of text I will use.<br>
                Plus I have added tables into this format, just to know how to work them.<br>
                I also added in a style page just to work on all the pages at once to write different styles without<br>
                having to do it in all of the places.<br>
                I even added new names and learned how to write in a background image.<br>
                Finally I have made different text fonts for the pages, for me to be able to get everything written<br>
                in a way that I know what it is saying.</p>
